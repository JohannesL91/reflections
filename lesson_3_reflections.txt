When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If I want to share my work with others or work together with others for a project. Also, if I can't work with the same computer at different locations, e.g. home and workplace...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If the changes are not complete yet or the changes are experimental, I don't want to share my current files with everyone. I don't want files, which were added by someone on my computer either, if I don't know what the changes were.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are cloned repositories on GitHub, clones are locally cloned repositories from GitHub and branches are different version paths in a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	On the one hand I can see what I did since I connected with GitHub. On the other hand, if something went wrong I have the possibility to go back to the working version without having to connect to the internet again.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Via mail, via USB drive, via Chat. Easier: No learning of software. Harder: no version-control

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	If I am not sure that the changes are approved for all collaborators or if I want feedback from the other collaborators. Different branch and pull-request: eveybody gets to see what was changed and master always works. Directly master: No need for complex checking and controlling all the different changes
