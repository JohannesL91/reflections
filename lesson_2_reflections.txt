What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created in the current folder and a new repository is created by the command "git init". I need it to do get the version control offered by GIT running. "git status" shows the current branch, the last commit and the files which are in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a step inbetween the working directory and the repository. It allows to chose the files I want to commit and make logical commits by doing so.
